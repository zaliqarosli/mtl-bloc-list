      "Allez Up is a premier climbing gym in Montreal, located at 1555 Saint-Patrick Street in the Pointe-Saint-Charles neighborhood. Known for its distinctive setting, it occupies a former industrial site, including the iconic silos of the Redpath Sugar refinery, which have been repurposed into climbing structures. The gym features a mix of indoor climbing walls and unique silo climbs reaching up to 125 feet (38 meters), making it one of the tallest climbing experiences in Canada.",
      "Opened in 1996, Allez Up underwent a significant redesign in 2013 led by Smith Vigeant Architectes. The revamped space features bright, angular climbing walls reminiscent of sugar cliffs, paying homage to the site's industrial history. The gym's large windows allow natural light to flood in, creating an inviting atmosphere for climbers of all skill levels."

    "vibe": "Allez Up was part of a broader effort to revitalize the Sud-Ouest area near the Lachine Canal. The gym transformed the historic Redpath Sugar Refinery’s abandoned silos into a unique climbing venue. This innovative adaptive reuse project was designed by Smith Vigeant Architectes and involved integrating industrial elements into a modern sports facility.",
